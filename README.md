# Frois' Chess Clock
A simple Arduino Chess Clock with 3 buttons and a 240X320 LCD screen

This is a simple chess clock project, developed during the quarantine. Mainly inspired by https://github.com/naldin/ArduinoChessClock, from @naldin. 
I changed his code so I could use only three buttons (pause, black and white) to choose the most commom time setting in chess competitions and display the hours in the LCD screen.
The project is currently stuck, since the Arduino Nano I was using for it is damaged and I couldn't find a new one. Altough the project is running pretty ok, you just need to correctly connect the LCD screen to the corresponding SPI pins and the buttons to whathever digital pin you want to. 
Also, I still need to print a 3D box to the clock or find one, making it played. Soon as I do it, I will update this page.
