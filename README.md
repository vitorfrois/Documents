# Frois' Chess Clock
A simple Arduino Chess Clock with 3 buttons and a 240X320 LCD screen

## About the project
This is a simple chess clock project, developed during the quarantine. Mainly inspired by https://github.com/naldin/ArduinoChessClock, from @naldin. 

I changed his code so I could use only three buttons (pause, black and white) to choose the most commom time setting in chess competitions and display the hours in the LCD screen.

## Features 
-Medium screen with big numbers

-3 strong button

-Most used FIDE time settings on setup

-Bonus time function

## Parts
-Arduino Nano

-Three big strong buttons

## Updates
The project is currently stuck, since the Arduino Nano I was using for it is damaged and I couldn't find a new one.

Also, I still need to print a 3D box to the clock or find one, making it playable.
